## Project Purpose
To analyze the rapid rise and fall of the COVID-19 pandemic and present the insights through an interactive dashboard. The project aims to provide a simple retrospective of the pandemic, leveraging data from its inception to its rapid eventual decline.

## Objectives

- Collect, clean, and store COVID-19-related data from reliable sources.

- Perform data exploration and transformation using Python, Excel, and MySQL.

- Create interactive and insightful visualizations using Tableau and Power BI.

- Provide actionable insights on the pandemic’s trends, peak periods, and decline.

- Deliver a fully functional dashboard

## Scope

- In-Scope:

  - Collection of COVID-19 data, including cases, deaths, tests and vaccination rates.

  - Data processing using Python, Excel, and MySQL for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load).

  - Development of data visualizations using Tableau and Power BI.

  - Deployment of a dashboard accessible to stakeholders.

- Out-of-Scope

  - Predictive modeling or forecasting of future pandemics.

  - Integration with live or real-time data feeds.


## Assumptions and Constraints

- Assumptions:

    - Data sources will provide reliable and complete COVID-19 datasets.

    - The tools used (Python, Excel, MySQL, Tableau, Power BI) are sufficient for the project’s scope.

    - Stakeholders will provide timely feedback during reviews.

- Constraints:

  - Limited budget for software licenses and infrastructure.

  - Dependence on historical data completeness and accuracy.

## Risk Overview

1. Data Quality Risks: Incomplete or inconsistent datasets may affect analysis.

* Mitigation: Use data validation techniques and reliable sources.

2. Technical Risks: Challenges in integrating tools (e.g., MySQL to Tableau).

* Mitigation: Conduct testing and ensure technical compatibility. Review available resources and workarounds

3. Timeline Risks: Delays in data preparation or dashboard development.

- Mitigation: Set buffer times and conduct regular progress reviews.
